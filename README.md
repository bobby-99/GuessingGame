# Guess the Number Game

Hey there, champ! Ready to put your guessing skills to the ultimate test? I've got a secret number, and you've got to find it. Simple, right? Hehehe... 😉

## What's the Game?
This is a classic 'Guess the Number' game where you try to pinpoint my hidden integer within a range you define. I'll give you hints, but don't take too long – your attempts are limited!

## Key Features:
* **Your Range, Your Rules:** You decide the lower and upper bounds for the secret number.
* **Choose Your Pain (or Pleasure):** Select from Easy (10 attempts), Mediocre (5 attempts), Hard (3 attempts), or go rogue with your own custom number of tries. 😏
* **Nudges & Nags:** I'll tell you if your guess is "Higher!" or "Smaller!"
* **Attempt Tracker:** Keep an eye on how many guesses you've burned.
* **Round 2?** Play again as many times as your ego can handle!

## How to Play:
1.  Save the code as `guess_the_number.py` (or whatever you fancy).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to where you saved the file.
4.  Run it like a boss: `python guess_the_number.py`
5.  Follow the prompts, unleash your inner detective, and try not to get a "Boo lol!" from me.

Good luck, you're going to need it! >_<
